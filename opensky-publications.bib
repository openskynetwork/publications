abstract = {Existing conflict resolution models are often based on theoretical frameworks that, while providing optimal solutions under specific criteria, may not fully align with real-world controller decision-making practices. This gap between model predictions and actual behaviour can lead to low acceptance of automated tools. Understanding how controllers resolve conflicts in daily operations could help design assistance tools that generate advisories more likely to be accepted and integrated into their workflow. This study introduces a data-driven methodology for identifying and cataloguing air traffic deconfliction instances using historical ADS-B data. By analysing trajectory deviations and their impact on predicted aircraft separations, we extract instances of deconfliction and encode them into a structured dataset. This dataset captures key elements of each event, including sector information, deviated aircraft details, predicted non-deviated trajectories, and surrounding traffic conditions. Our approach facilitates large-scale analysis of air traffic control decision-making, providing a foundation for developing conflict resolution models that better reflect operational practices. This paper details the methodology and process used to construct this dataset.}

TITLE = {LLM-Driven Adaptive Prompt Optimization Framework for ADS-B Anomaly Detection},
JOURNAL = {Aerospace},
VOLUME = {12},
YEAR = {2025},
NUMBER = {10},

ABSTRACT = {The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is a key component of the new-generation air traffic surveillance system. However, it is vulnerable to security threats due to its plaintext transmission and lack of authentication mechanisms. Existing ADS-B anomaly detection methods still suffer from significant limitations, including low anomaly detection rates and limited adaptability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel ADS-B anomaly detection framework driven by large language models (LLMs). The approach utilizes pre-trained LLMs and a self-iterative prompt optimization loop, which integrates historical trajectories and multimodal features to refine expert-initialized prompts. The optimized prompts guide the LLM in identifying ADS-B anomalies. The advantage of the proposed ADS-B anomaly detection framework lies in overcoming the limitation of traditional model adaptation. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves excellent performance on key metrics: the anomaly detection rate of 98.55%, the false alarm rate controlled at 3.61%, the miss detection rate reduced to 1.45%, and a recall of 96.39%. Compared to traditional detection methods, this method improves detection accuracy by an average of more than 12%. Furthermore, experiments on multi-type anomaly detection tasks validate that the framework exhibits strong adaptability and good generalization, providing effective technical support for the development of aviation data security protection systems.},

TITLE = {Identification of Traffic Flow Spatio-Temporal Patterns and Their Associated Weather Factors: A Case Study in the Terminal Airspace of Hong Kong},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a data-driven framework aimed at investigating how weather factors affect the spatio-temporal patterns of air traffic flow in the terminal maneuvering area (TMA) is presented. The framework mainly consists of three core modules, namely, trajectory structure characterization, flow pattern recognition, and association rule mining. To fully characterize trajectory structure, abnormal trajectories and typical operations are sequentially extracted based on a deep autoencoder network with two specially designed loss functions. Then, using these extracted elements as basic components to further construct and cluster per-hour-level descriptions of airspace structure, the spatio-temporal patterns of air traffic flow can be recognized. Finally, the association rule mining technique is applied to find sets of weather factors that often appear together with each flow pattern. Experimental analysis is demonstrated on two months of arrival flight trajectories at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). The results clearly show that the proposed framework effectively captures spatial anomalies, fine-grained trajectory structures, and representative flow patterns. More importantly, it also reveals that those flow patterns with non-conforming behaviors result from complex interactions of various weather factors. The findings provide valuable insights into the causal relationships between weather factors and changes in flow patterns, greatly enhancing the situational awareness of TMA.},

This chapter is divided into two parts, the first delves with the diversity of environments for data sources, ranging from importation of structured data or the use of APIs to the more advanced usage od scraping tools for cases when data is not prepared to be downloaded explicitly. Then advanced features that allow to transform raw data into ready to analyze tables are discussed with special focus on the exceptionally fast data.table.",
